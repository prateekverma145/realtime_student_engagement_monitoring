# Classroom Engagement Monitor

## Description

The "Classroom Engagement Monitor" challenge invites participants to leverage Computer Vision technology to develop an innovative system for tracking and analyzing student participation in the classroom. The primary objective is to create a robust solution that utilizes Computer Vision algorithms to monitor and assess student engagement levels during academic sessions. Participants are encouraged to design a prototype that intelligently captures and evaluates student interactions, expressions, and attentiveness in real-time. The anticipated solution should employ Computer Vision techniques to accurately measure and interpret student engagement, offering valuable insights for educators to enhance classroom dynamics. The ultimate goal is to develop an intelligent monitoring system that optimizes student participation and fosters a more interactive and engaging learning environment.
